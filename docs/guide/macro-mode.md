# Macro mode

Add the plugin once and your parser imports are evaluated and compiled at build time.
The `parseman` import disappears from the bundle entirely, leaving flat, allocation-light
JavaScript in its place.

## 1. Register the plugin

Parséman ships an [unplugin](https://github.com/unjs/unplugin)-based plugin, so the same
export adapts to every major bundler.

::: code-group

```ts [vite.config.ts]
import parseman from 'parseman/plugin'

export default {
  plugins: [parseman()],
}
```

```js [rollup.config.js]
import parseman from 'parseman/plugin'

export default {
  plugins: [parseman.rollup()],
}
```

```js [webpack.config.js]
const parseman = require('parseman/plugin')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [parseman.webpack()],
}
```

:::

## 2. Import with `with { type: 'macro' }`

```ts
import { literal, sequence, choice, regex, transform } from 'parseman' with { type: 'macro' }
```

Same combinators, no other changes. The plugin walks each initializer, evaluates it at
build time, and replaces it with an inline function.

## What gets emitted

A `choice` over string literals with disjoint first characters compiles to a single
`codePointAt` dispatch:

```js
// Before (source):
const method = choice(literal('GET'), literal('POST'), literal('PUT'), literal('DELETE'))

// After (bundle output):
const method = function (input, _pos, _ctx) {
  const _code = _pos < input.length ? input.codePointAt(_pos) : -1
  if      (_code === 71) { /* G-E-T    */ }
  else if (_code === 80) { /* P-O-S-T  */ }
  else if (_code === 68) { /* D-E-L-E-T-E */ }
  else return { ok: false, expected: ['"GET"', '"POST"', …], span: { start: _pos, end: _pos } }
  …
}
```

- **Disjoint first characters** → a single `codePointAt` dispatch instead of trying each
  arm.
- **Regex parsers** → sticky `/pattern/y` hoisted to closure scope.
- **Failure paths** allocate no objects.

## What gets compiled

The plugin compiles combinator trees end to end:

- All the core combinators — `literal`, `regex`, `sequence`, `choice`, `many`,
  `oneOrMore`, `optional`, `sepBy`, `transform`, `skip`, `not`, `scanTo`, `balanced`.
- `rules()` factories, **including mutually recursive ones** — emitted as mutually
  recursive named functions (`_pf0`, …) so the cycle is broken.
- `parser({ trivia })` / `noTrivia()` wrappers.
- `node()` rules — CST capture, trivia logging, and all — with every `build` / `transform`
  callback inlined at its source span.

A full grammar built as a `rules()` factory of `node()` rules compiles end to end: each
rule becomes an independently-callable function, terminal/trivia capture is emitted
inline, and grammars with no `node()` emit zero capture code (so they compile
byte-identically to the non-CST version).

Both binding forms compile:

```ts
const { value } = rules(…)   // each rule becomes a top-level function
const grammar   = rules(…)   // an object literal of compiled rules; grammar.value(…) works
```

Parsers that close over external variables the evaluator can't resolve are left as-is —
the plugin compiles what it can and quietly leaves the rest to the interpreter.

## Debugging still works

The plugin emits a precise source map via
[magic-string](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/magic-string). Breakpoints set on the
original `choice(...)` lines are hit when the compiled function runs; step-through shows
the original combinator source, not the emitted charCode checks.

If `with { type: 'macro' }` is stripped (older bundlers, test runners), the attribute is
silently ignored and the interpreter runs instead — identical results, no errors.

## When the plugin can't compile something

If the plugin meets a macro-imported declaration it can't compile statically — it closes
over a runtime value, or isn't a recognized combinator shape — it:

1. leaves that declaration for the interpreter,
2. strips the `with { type: 'macro' }` attribute so the import stays valid, and
3. emits a build **warning** (`[parseman] file:line — …`) pointing at it.

So a silent fallback never goes unnoticed — you'll see exactly which rule dropped to the
interpreter and why.
